Hi I'm Sven

I work as a Senior IT Engineer on automation and cloud technologies.

My roots are in the open source movement, which shaped me during my studies and entrepreneurs period and influenced my strong community oriented and knowledge sharing mindset.

My interests for Open Medical Earth are to apply Open Software / Open Hardware principles to the medical area for empowering people on simple solutions to help themself.

We live in rich countries where we benefit from modern healthcare but we also should respect the fact, that many countries on our earth do not have access to basic healthcare.
